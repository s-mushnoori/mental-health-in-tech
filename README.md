# mental-health-in-tech

Mental health often goes untreated in many individuals. The purpose of this project is to gauge the perception of mental health in the tech industry. [OSMI](https://osmihelp.org/) (Open Sourcing Mental Illness) released surveys in 2016 and 2017 to measure attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace, and examine the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers. The 2018 survey is ongoing. Taking this into account, the 2017 data set was used for the analysis. The 2016 data set was also utilized to get an idea of any evolving trends. The data sets can be found here: [2016](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016/data), [2017](https://www.kaggle.com/osmihelp/osmi-mental-health-in-tech-survey-2017/data). The code and analysis can be viewed in `00_Cleaning&Visualization.ipynb`.

The analysis follow the structure laid out below:

1. **Demographics**
The demographics of the survey respondents will be useful to get an idea of the types of employees in the tech industry. Some questions that will be analyzed are:
  - What are the age and gender distributions in the industry?
  - What are the typical employee types (self employed, tech role etc.)?
  - What are the  most common mental health disorders (MHDs) among tech employees?
  - How prevalent are MHDs based on gender and age?

2. **Perception of Mental Health**
Although there have been great strides in making mental health easier to talk about, there is often some stigma associated with bringing up issues related to mental health. With regard to people's careers, this negative perception can show itself during interviews, and at work.

3. **Role of the employer**
